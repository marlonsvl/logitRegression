###Output

The p value is less of 0.0001 for three variables.

I can say. Are those with antisocial personality and anxiety disorder  more or less likely to be depression life?.

For answer this question we choose odds ratios as opposed to coefficients

###Odds Ratio

People with depression are 3.69 times more likely to have depression disorder thtan without antisocial disorder. Based on our model those with antisocial disorder are anywhere from 3.29 to 4.14 times more likely to have depression than without antisocial disorder. The odds ratio is a sample statistic and the confidence intervals are an stimate of population parameter 

There are no confounding effects to be found in the analysis with variables selected.
